Sentiment Analysis

This is a python project for analyzing the sentiment of text data using natural language processing techniques. The project includes the following features:

    Cleaning and preprocessing of text data
    Extracting features from text data using techniques such as bag-of-words and TF-IDF
    Training and evaluating machine learning models for sentiment analysis
    Providing a simple API for making sentiment predictions on new text data

Requirements

    Python 3.6 or higher
    pandas
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    NLTK
    textblob
    keras (if using neural network models)

Usage
Data Preparation

    The first step is to prepare the dataset. It should be in csv format and should have two columns: text and sentiment, where text is the text data, and sentiment is the label indicating the sentiment of the text (e.g. "positive", "negative").

Data Cleaning

    Once you have the dataset ready, you can use the clean_text() function for cleaning the text data. This function removes punctuation, stopwords, and performs stemming or lemmatization on the text.

Extracting Features

    Next, you can use the extract_features() function to extract features from the text data. This function creates a bag-of-words representation of the text data and applies TF-IDF weighting.

Model Training

    Once the features have been extracted, you can use the train_model() function to train a machine learning model on the data. This function supports several different types of models, including logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest and neural networks.

Model Evaluation

    After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using the evaluate_model() function. This function returns a variety of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Making Predictions

    Finally, you can use the predict_sentiment() function to make sentiment predictions on new text data. This function takes a single string of text as input and returns a sentiment label (e.g. "positive", "negative").
